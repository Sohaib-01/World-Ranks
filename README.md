This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

This is an application I built by following a tutorial done by a software developer on Youtube, called Thu Nghiem. The application was built using React and Next.js.

By building this application I was able to learn:

- Data sorting and filtering
- Creating a responsive layout without any CSS framework (this was a challenge)
- Created a Dark/Light Mode for the page
- Sever-side rendering (something new for me)
- Deploying with Vercel (again something new for me)

I thank Thu Nghiem (https://github.com/nghiemthu) for doing this tutorial as it enabled me to learn various new things in the world of coding. Hopefully I will be able to use the skills I have learnt here into my other future projects.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/import?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
